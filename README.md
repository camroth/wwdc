WWDC
====

My entry to Apple's Student Scholarship program for WWDC 2013.

The bundle identifier is 'me' since I now intend to use this as a resume app. I might make some changes, but I'm pretty satisfied with how it ended up given the tight time-frame. This was done start-to-finish in about 20 hours over the course of two days.

It's not immediately obvious, but you can also drag the words at the top to fast-navigate through the panels. The initial animation is to teach the user how to use the app to clear up discovery. There's some more user-leading to find the project portfolio, but I'm sure you'll find itâ€¦

Hopefully this helps someone. Enjoy!
